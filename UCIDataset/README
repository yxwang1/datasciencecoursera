I am using 'dplyr' library.

The run_analysis.R code has headings that indicated the 5 tasks that needs to be done. They are in the sequence listed in the assignment requirement except #4, adding the column names were done before other tasks.

The final output file is called tidyDataset.txt. 

It's the result of merging training set with test set, binding in subject, activity label
number in the columns called subject and activityLabel. The result is then grouped by subject and labelIndex, and summarized over numeric columns with a mean.

Here's summary of the data: (30 subject * 6 activities = 180 rows
                              561 features + subject + activityLabel = 563 columns)

> dim(tidyDataset)
[1] 180 563

> head(tidyDataset)
